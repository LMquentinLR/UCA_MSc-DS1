## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document to follow the lecture 4 of the MSc in Data Science & AI at Université Côte-d'Azur. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r murders}
summary(murders)
```

```{r iris}
summary(iris)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)

#plot(rnorm(100,1,2))
```

```{r}
plot(iris[1:4],col=iris$Species)
```

### Knitr Table

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(mtcars[1:5,], caption="A knitr table.")
```

### CMD

```{cmd}
dir
```

## Introduction 
This is a report on 2010 gun murder rates obtained from FBI reports. The original data was obtained from [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_the_United_States_by_state). We are going to use the following library: 
```{r loading-libs, message=FALSE} 
library(tidyverse) 
``` 
### Download the data here
[data](https://github.com/rairizarry/murders/blob/master/rdas/murders.rda)
and load the data: 
```{r} 
load("./murders.rda") 
``` 
## Murder rate by state 
We note the large state to state variability by generating a barplot showing the murder rate by state: 
```{r murder-rate-by-state, echo=FALSE} 
murders %>% mutate(abb = reorder(abb, rate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(abb, rate)) + geom_bar(width = 0.5, stat = "identity", color = "black") + coord_flip() 
```

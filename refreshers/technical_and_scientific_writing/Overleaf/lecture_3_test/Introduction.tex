\section{\bf{Introduction}}

The following is the formula for the \textbf{density function of the Normal Distribution}.  It is noted for a random variable $X$ as $X\rightarrow N(\mu,\sigma)$
$$ N\rightarrow\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}.e^{\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{\sigma}}$$
This is a \textbf{test} \textit{citation}\cite{NIPS2019_8688} to see if the referencing works.

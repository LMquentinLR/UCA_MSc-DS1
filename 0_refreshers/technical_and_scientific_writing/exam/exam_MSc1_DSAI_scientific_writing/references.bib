	abstract = {The research problem considered in the article was the relationship between the involvement level of entrepreneurs in the implementation of the GDPR and their perception on the market. The existence of the problem was based on numerous signals of Customer dissatisfaction with the level of protection of their personal data and the data they are processing. The research covered a group of businessmen who distinguished activities related to accounting services, human resources, legal services, health and safety from the structure of their enterprises. The conclusions were formulated based on direct interviews, critical analysis of secondary sources and the scrutiny of case studies presented. The results showed high correspondence, mainly about the selection of a company that outsources personal data processing. The tenderer’s selection procedures are increasingly being extended by demands for the accuracy of the level of privacy protection and are important in decision making process. The purpose of the article was to show that the level of implementation of the processes ensuring customers’ privacy protection, consistent with the provisions of the GDPR, has an impact on companies’ competitiveness. The hypothesis put forward was clearly confirmed by the analysis of the results of the conducted research.},

	abstract = {Scholars and commentators often argue that individuals do not care about their privacy, and that users routinely trade privacy for convenience. This ignores the cognitive biases and design tactics platforms use to manipulate users into disclosing information. This essay highlights some of those cognitive biases – from hyperbolic discounting to the problem of overchoice – and discusses the ways in which platform design can manipulate disclosure. It then explains how current law allows this manipulative and anti-consumer behavior to continue and proposes a new approach to reign in the phenomenon.},

	abstract = {New consent management platforms (CMPs) have been introduced to the web to conform with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, particularly its requirements for consent when companies collect and process users’ personal data. This work analyses how the most prevalent CMP designs affect people’s consent choices. We scraped the designs of the five most popular CMPs on the top 10,000 websites in the UK (n=680). We found that dark patterns and implied consent are ubiquitous; only 11.8\% meet the minimal requirements that we set based on European law. Second, we conducted a field experiment with 40 participants to investigate how the eight most common designs affect consent choices. We found that notification style (banner or barrier) has no effect; removing the opt-out button from the first page increases consent by 22–23 percentage points; and providing more granular controls on the first page decreases consent by 8–20 percentage points. This study provides an empirical basis for the necessary regulatory action to enforce the GDPR, in particular the possibility of focusing on the centralised, third-party CMP services as an effective way to increase compliance.},

	shorttitle = {'{Dark} {Patterns}'},
	abstract = {‘Dark patterns’ is a term commonly used by the web collective to describe a user interface that exploits users into doing something that they would not normally do. It is a coercive and manipulative design technique used by web designers when some sort of action is needed from a user - typically to begin the processing of personal data or indication of agreement to a contract. As dark patterns can compromise legal requirements like consent and privacy-by-design and legal principles found in both regimes, like fairness and transparency, this article analyses ‘dark patterns’ from a regulatory perspective. Two frameworks are critiqued: the European Union’s regime for data privacy and consumer protection. The paper also provides an overview of the enforcement measures available for the regulation of dark patterns. It concludes that a pluralistic approach that mixes the strengths of one regulatory regime while compensating for its weaknesses by the use of the other is needed to harness dark patterns.},

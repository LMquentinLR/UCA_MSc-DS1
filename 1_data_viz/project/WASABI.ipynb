        "Potential users of a music-related app will likely show interest in in-depth information related to music genres, their prevalence, spread, etc. across time and countries. As such, users might want access to the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "- A Sankey diagram showing how artists' genre evolves over time, the relationship between genres and the weight of each genre. (e.g. An artist's career starts on Soul and moves to Pop and Neon Soul in posterior years) \n",
        "\n",
        "- A data visualization tool that showcases the prevalence of a music genre within a country and within a time period (e.g. Heavy Metal is *heavily* represented in the Nordics since the 1980s). A choropleth would allow a user to select a genre and a time period and see the ratio of bands in that genre divided by the total population number (a density representation used in music-specialized magazines).\n",

        "## 2. Visual Tasks To Implement\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Historical Evolution of the artists' genres**: A sankey diagram having on the horizontal axis different periods on time (specifically quinquenniums), and nodes in each quinquenium denoting the genre. The thickness of the bands from one node to the other will be determined by the quantity of albums.  \n",
        "\n",
        "- **Music Genre Prevalence by Country**: A (zoomable?) world choropleth map where each country is colored as a heatmap based on the ratio of bands playing a specific genre during a specific decade *per capita*. Hovering over a country would open a tooltip box that would provide more information (e.g. absolute number of bands, total population of the country, etc.)\n",
